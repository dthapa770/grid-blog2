              CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or 
              defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, 
              between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.

              Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows. 
              However, many more layouts are either possible or easier with CSS grid 
              than they were with tables. 
          </p>       
          <p class= "boxed">
              For example, a grid container's child elements could position themselves 
              so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements.

        <h2>Grid Lines</h2>
        <p>
            Grid lines are created when you define tracks in the explicit grid using CSS Grid Layout.
            Lines are also created in the implicit grid when implicit tracks are created to hold content positioned outside of the explicit grid, however these lines cannot be addressed by a number.
        </p>
        <h3>Placing items onto the grid by line number</h3>
        <p>
            Having created a grid, you can place items onto the grid by line number.
        </p>
        <pre class="boxed">
           <code>
              &ltdiv class="wrapper">
              &ltdiv class="item">Item&lt/div>
              &lt/div>
           </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
          Lines can be addressed using their line number.
           In a left-to-right language such as English, column line 1 will be on the left of the grid, row line 1 on the top. 
           Lines numbers respect the writing mode of the document and so in a right-to-left language for example. 
      </p>
      <h3>Naming lines</h3>
      <p>
          The lines created in the explicit grid can be named, by adding the name in square brackets before or after the track sizing information.
          When placing an item, you can then use these names instead of the line number, as demonstrated below.The lines created in the explicit grid can be named, by adding the name in square brackets before or after the track sizing information.

          Grid is a powerful specification that, when combined with other parts of CSS such as flexbox,
          can help you create layouts that were previously impossible to build in CSS.

           We create a grid container by declaring display: grid or display: inline-grid on an element.
